5. Moreover, You can modify & update your info or if you need to do that later, you can do so from update_login_info.py which is accessible from Login.py once you click the REGISTER button.

6. There's also a spare part folder that comes as an additional bonus which is not in use by default but you can further replace it with both Login.py and Register.py files if you want to.

7. Another window just opens alongside the Library itself which can navigate to other tools that are available in the Additional Complementary Tools folder per se.

8. There are release notes named Compact-Specific which are used to explain all features of each Tool and Applet ensuring more convenience.
