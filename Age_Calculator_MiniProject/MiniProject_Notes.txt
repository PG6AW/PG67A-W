This simple age calculator that comes in two versions of CLI AND GUI , might be a useful tool during the mad dash of a transfer in hospitals.
It just calculates patient's age by getting its solar or gregorian birth year while in haste!	That's it!

	If there's no time or one is distressed enough to think which year it currently is and then calculate someone's age manually or by using a calculator, this can be a helpful tool for
	both people who are using gregorian or the solar datetime! GOOD LUCK!



	* MADE WITH LOVE FOR ANYONE WHO SPEAKS PERSIAN AND USES SOLAR DATETIME SYSTEM, AND THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT USE GREGORIAN DATE! *
